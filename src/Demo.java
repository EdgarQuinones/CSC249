 * Purpose of Program:
 * 
 * Use the following information to create a program that allows the user 
 * to manipulate a music playlist and view its content. Your program should 
 * contain 3 separate classes: a Song class, a Playlist class, and a Demo 
 * class. In this program, the Playlist class will function as a doubly linked
 * list that contains Song objects. The Demo class will be used to make 
 * modifications to the Playlist.

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Playlist object

		/*

		 * 
		 * 1. add dont to playlist

		 * 2. insert new song after the song that is currently playing (If playlist
		 * empty, it should become currently playing song)
		 * 
		 * 3. print contents of playlist
		 * 
		 * 4. display current song (When displaying the current song for the first time,
		 * the first song in the playlist should be displayed. To accomplish this,
		 * create a Song reference variable and assign it the first Song in the
		 * Playlist)

		 * 
		 * 6. skip to the next song(if end of playlist, go back to first song
		 *

		 * previous Song should be the last Song in the playlist.)
		 * 
		 * Require valid input from user, if input wrong, correct user and ask again
		 * 
		 * If any of the options chosen would not work due to there being no applicable
		 * songs in the playlist, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
		 * 
		 * The user should be allowed to repeatedly select menu options until they
		 * choose to Exit.
