### Purpose of Program:
This program enables users to manage a music playlist, allowing them to add, remove, and view songs. It's structured using three main classes: the Song class for individual song details, the Playlist class which organizes songs in a doubly linked list format for efficient manipulation, and the Demo class that provides the user interface for interacting with the playlist.
