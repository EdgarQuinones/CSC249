### Purpose of Program:
Use the following information to create a program that allows the user to manipulate a music playlist and view its content. Your program should contain 3 separate classes: a Song class, a Playlist class, and a Demo class. In this program, the Playlist class will function as a doubly linked list that contains Song objects. The Demo class will be used to make modifications to the Playlist.
